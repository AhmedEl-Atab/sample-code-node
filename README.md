# Node.js Sample Code for Authorize.Net SDK  

This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Node.js integration with the Authorize.Net Node.js SDK (https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-node).  
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly here: http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference


##Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

##Running the Samples  
#Clone this repository.
````
    $ git clone https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-nodejs.git
````  
# Install the SDK
````
    $ npm install authorizenet
````

# Run Sample Code
````
    $ node PaymentTransactions\authorize-credit-card.js
````
